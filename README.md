> This is a Codecademy project Capstone. This is a project using the data structure Hash Map . 
The food types and restaurants are stored in a Hash Map and retrieved by typing the first few letters of
the Food type which then narrows down the list to a single food type.
Then the Restaurant data structure is searched and all restaurants  with that food type are then
called up.
